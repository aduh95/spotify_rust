# Spotify CLI

The command line tool spotify_cli can control your Spotify playback without having to use your mouse. 

## Getting Started

Just clone the repository and cargo run !
It is not usable for now, just a work in progress.


### Prerequisites

Well before you can run there are some prerequisites :
- *Rust* 
- A *Spotify client id/secret pair*, and a *refresh token*


### Installing

TODOs

## Running the tests

TODO

## Built With

External crates :
- `curl` for sending HTTP requests. 
- `serde_json` for JSON parsing.
- `percent-encoding` to encode search queries in percent encoding.
- `termion` and `tui` for the text user interface 
- `clap` for the command line interpreter

## Contributing

As I would love to have contributors, the project is unfortunately not mature enough to be on the hands of the masses..

I would rather finish to get a strong basis on which contributors could expand the software.

Feel free to open pull requests or mail me if you have any question.
